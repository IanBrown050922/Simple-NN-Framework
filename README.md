# Simple-NN-Framework
basic Neural Network Framework made with numpy

This project provides a framework for creating multilayer neural networks with dense layers. No additional deep learning frameworks were used, only numpy to make the math shorter.

I used the MNIS dataset stored in .npy files in a local directory called "MNIST" (see the comment in main). As the data is too large to upload, you may choose any training/testing data you like as long as it is in .npy format.
