# Simple-NN-Framework
basic Neural Network Framework made with numpy

This project provides a framework for creating multilayer neural networks with dense layers. No additional deep learning frameworks were used, only numpy to make the math shorter.

I used the MNIST dataset stored in .npy files in a local directory called "MNIST" (see the comment on line 60 in Main.py). As the dataset is too large to upload, you may choose any training/testing data you like as long as it is in .npy format. Simply save the data in a local directory and change the file names on lines 61 and 63 in Main.py.
